         <td><p>Beebo was adopted in 2017 by her humans.  
            Her former name was Esmerelda which certainly matches her sass, but didn't quite fit her lovable nature.  
            Hence, she was named after a cartoon alien beast residing on the planet Venzenulon 7 
            who demonstrated great loyalty, friendship, and sacrifice.

            into the year 2000, having fallen in just as 1999 ended, then revived in 2999 to became 
            a Delivery boy for the Planet Express Company.
