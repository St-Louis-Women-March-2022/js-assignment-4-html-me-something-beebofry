         <td><p>Beebo was adopted in 2017 by her humans.  
            Her former name was Esmerelda which certainly matches her sass, but didn't quite fit her lovable nature.  
            Hence, she was named after a cartoon alien beast residing on the planet Venzenulon 7 
            who demonstrated great loyalty, friendship, and sacrifice. 
            Beebo (the dog) loves cheese, laying belly up in the sun, chasing bunnies, and becoming one with couch.</p>

            His former name was Chris. Just Chris.   
            Therefore, he was named after a goofy, yet big hearted cartoon character cryogenically frozen seconds 
            into the year 2000, having fallen in just as 1999 ended, then revived in 2999 to became 
            a Delivery boy for the Planet Express Company.
            Fry (the dog) loves wiggling like a worm, all things rope, peanut butter, and his sister Beebo who tolerates him.</p>
